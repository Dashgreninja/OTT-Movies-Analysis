# 🎬 OTT Movie Scout: Finding Our Next Big Hit

### **The Goal**
Deciding which movie to add to a streaming platform is a multi-million dollar gamble. Usually, people just look at how popular a movie is. But I wanted to be smarter. I built an automated system that finds movies that are **popular** AND **profitable**. 

I used a special **80/20 Rule** to rank them:
* **80% Audience Buzz:** (Do people love it?)
* **20% ROI:** (Was it a good deal for the money?)

---

### **📊 The Final Result**
This is the "brain" of the project. The podium automatically updates to show the top 3 movies we should buy right now based on our 80/20 math.

### **🛠️ How It Works (The Tech Stack)**
I used three tools to make this happen without having to do manual work every day:

1.  **Python:** My "Data Collector." It uses the TMDB API to grab the latest movie stats.
2.  **Power Automate Desktop:** My "Manager." It handles the automation loop—running the script and refreshing the data.
3.  **Power BI:** My "Presenter." It turns messy numbers into the interactive dashboard you see above.

### **🔄 The Automation Flow**
I didn't want to run code manually every time. I set up a **Power Automate** flow so that everything happens with one click.

**What happens in this flow:**
* It opens a Command Prompt window so you can watch the Python script work in real-time.
* It waits for the script to finish downloading the data.
* It automatically refreshes the Power BI dashboard so the charts update instantly.

### **🔍 Strategic Analysis**
I also created a **Strategic Acquisition Map** (a scatter chart). This helps us see which movies are "low risk" and which ones are "superstars."

### **⚙️ Requirements to Run**
If you want to run this project on your machine, you will need:
* **Python installed**.
* **A TMDB API Key** (to get the movie data).
* **🌍 A VPN (Mandatory):** The TMDB API requires a VPN to connect properly in certain regions. Make sure your VPN is **ON** before running the script.
* **Power BI Desktop** to open the report.

### **📂 Project Structure**
* **`/data`**: Stores the movie spreadsheets.
* **`/src`**: Contains the Python extraction code.
* **`/powerbi`**: Contains the Power BI `.pbix` file.
